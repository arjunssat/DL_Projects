About the Project
The project involves working with a dataset of Muslim names to analyze and generate new names. Techniques such as preprocessing, bi-gram modeling, encoding/decoding, probability calculations, and neural network modeling are used. The project aims to explore patterns, predict next characters, calculate likelihoods, and generate new names using the trained model.

Dataset Description
The Muslim Names dataset is a comprehensive collection of names commonly used among Muslims worldwide. This dataset consists of over 15,000 unique Muslim names, making it a valuable resource for various applications such as research, data analysis, and cultural studies.
